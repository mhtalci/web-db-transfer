# macOS with Homebrew
brew install go

# Windows
# Download installer from https://golang.org/dl/
```

### Can I run this in a Docker container?
Yes, Docker containers are fully supported:
```bash
# Run CLI in container
docker run -it migration-assistant/migration-assistant:latest migration-assistant --help

# Run API server in container
docker run -p 8000:8000 migration-assistant/migration-assistant:latest migration-assistant serve

# Mount configuration files
docker run -v $(pwd)/config:/config migration-assistant/migration-assistant:latest migration-assistant migrate --config /config/migration.yaml
```

##  Performance and Scalability

### How fast are migrations?
Performance depends on several factors:
- **Data size**: Typical speeds of 2-5 MB/s for file transfers
- **Network bandwidth**: Limited by available bandwidth
- **Go acceleration**: 2-3x faster than Python-only operations
- **Parallel transfers**: Configurable parallelism (default: 4 threads)

**Typical Migration Times**:
- Small website (< 1GB): 10-20 minutes
- Medium website (1-10GB): 30-90 minutes
- Large website (10-100GB): 2-8 hours
- Enterprise migration (100GB+): 8+ hours

### Can I run multiple migrations simultaneously?
Yes, the Migration Assistant supports:
- **Batch migrations**: Process multiple sites in parallel
- **API concurrency**: Multiple API clients can run migrations simultaneously
- **Resource management**: Configurable limits to prevent system overload
- **Queue management**: Automatic queuing and scheduling of migrations

### How do I optimize migration performance?
**Performance Tuning Options**:
```yaml
# Enable Go acceleration
performance:
  use_go_engine: true
  max_parallel_transfers: 8
  chunk_size: "50MB"
  compression: true

# Database optimization
database_migration:
  parallel_jobs: 4
  batch_size: 10000
  disable_indexes: true  # Rebuild after migration
```

### What are the scalability limits?
**Tested Limits**:
- **File count**: Successfully tested with 1M+ files
- **Database size**: Tested with databases up to 1TB
- **Concurrent migrations**: Up to 10 simultaneous migrations per server
- **API throughput**: 1000+ requests per minute

## 🔐 Security and Privacy

### How are credentials stored and transmitted?
**Security Measures**:
- Credentials stored in environment variables or encrypted configuration files
- All network communications use encrypted connections (HTTPS, SSH, TLS)
- API authentication via JWT tokens, API keys, or OAuth2
- Support for SSH key authentication instead of passwords
- Integration with credential management systems (AWS Secrets Manager, etc.)

### Is data encrypted during migration?
Yes, multiple encryption layers:
- **In transit**: All data transfers use encrypted protocols (SSH, HTTPS, TLS)
- **At rest**: Temporary files can be encrypted using system encryption
- **Database connections**: All database connections use SSL/TLS encryption
- **Cloud storage**: Integration with cloud encryption services

### What data is logged?
**Logging Practices**:
- Migration progress and status information
- Error messages and debugging information
- Performance metrics and timing data
- **NOT logged**: Passwords, API keys, or sensitive data content
- Configurable log levels and retention policies

### Can I run migrations in air-gapped environments?
Partial support for air-gapped environments:
- **Offline mode**: CLI can work without internet for local migrations
- **Package dependencies**: All Python dependencies can be pre-installed
- **Go binaries**: Can be compiled and distributed separately
- **Limitations**: Cloud migrations require internet connectivity

##  Troubleshooting

### What should I do if a migration fails?
**Immediate Steps**:
1. Check the error message and logs: `migration-assistant logs --session SESSION_ID`
2. Verify connectivity: `migration-assistant validate --quick --config your-config.yaml`
3. Try resuming: `migration-assistant migrate --resume SESSION_ID`
4. If needed, rollback: `migration-assistant rollback --session SESSION_ID`

### How do I resume a failed migration?
```bash
# Resume from last checkpoint
migration-assistant migrate --resume SESSION_ID

# Resume with different settings
migration-assistant migrate --resume SESSION_ID --parallel 2

# Retry only failed items
migration-assistant migrate --retry-failed --session SESSION_ID
```

### Can I rollback a migration?
Yes, rollback capabilities include:
- **Automatic rollback**: On migration failure (if enabled)
- **Manual rollback**: Using backup files created before migration
- **Partial rollback**: Rollback specific components (files, database, configuration)
- **Verification**: Test rollback procedures before execution
