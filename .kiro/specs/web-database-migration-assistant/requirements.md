# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The Web & Database Migration Assistant is a comprehensive Python-based tool that provides both CLI and API interfaces for migrating web applications and databases between different systems, platforms, and environments. The tool offers an interactive CLI for guided migrations and a FastAPI-based REST API for programmatic access, with support for common platform presets and automation features.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer or system administrator, I want to specify my source and destination systems through both CLI and API interfaces, so that I can configure migrations interactively or programmatically.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user starts the CLI migration wizard THEN the system SHALL present an interactive step-by-step form using Click and prompt_toolkit
2. WHEN the user selects a source system type THEN the system SHALL display relevant configuration options with Rich-formatted output
3. WHEN the user selects a destination system type THEN the system SHALL display relevant configuration options with validation
4. WHEN the user accesses the API THEN the system SHALL provide endpoints to configure migrations programmatically
5. WHEN using presets (WordPress/MySQL, Django/Postgres, etc.) THEN the system SHALL auto-populate common configuration values
6. WHEN all required fields are completed THEN the system SHALL enable the confirmation step

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a user migrating data, I want to configure database migration settings with support for multiple database types, so that I can ensure my data is transferred correctly between different database systems.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user specifies a relational database (MySQL, PostgreSQL, SQLite, SQL Server) THEN the system SHALL use appropriate Python connectors (mysql-connector-python, psycopg2, sqlite3, pyodbc)
2. WHEN the user specifies a NoSQL database (MongoDB, Redis, Cassandra) THEN the system SHALL use appropriate Python drivers (pymongo, redis-py, cassandra-driver)
3. WHEN the user specifies cloud databases (AWS RDS, Google Cloud SQL, Azure SQL) THEN the system SHALL use cloud SDKs for authentication and connection
4. WHEN the user selects a migration method THEN the system SHALL validate compatibility between source and destination database types
5. IF the selected migration method is incompatible THEN the system SHALL display an error message and suggest alternative methods
6. WHEN database credentials are provided THEN the system SHALL validate connectivity using the appropriate Python connector

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a user migrating files, I want to choose from multiple transfer methods using Python libraries, so that I can optimize the migration process based on my infrastructure and requirements.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user selects SSH/SCP/SFTP transfer THEN the system SHALL use paramiko library for secure file transfers
2. WHEN the user selects rsync THEN the system SHALL execute rsync via subprocess with proper error handling
3. WHEN the user selects FTP/FTPS THEN the system SHALL use ftputil library for file transfers
4. WHEN the user selects cloud storage (S3, GCS, Azure Blob) THEN the system SHALL use boto3, google-cloud-storage, or azure-storage-blob respectively
5. WHEN the user selects Docker volumes THEN the system SHALL use docker-py for container volume migrations
6. WHEN the user selects Kubernetes THEN the system SHALL use kubernetes Python client for pod and volume migrations
7. IF the selected transfer method is unavailable THEN the system SHALL suggest alternative methods

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a user performing migrations, I want safety features like backups and rollback capabilities, so that I can recover if something goes wrong during the migration process.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN backup creation is enabled THEN the system SHALL create backups of both source and destination systems before migration
2. WHEN rollback on failure is enabled THEN the system SHALL automatically restore from backups if migration fails
3. WHEN integrity verification is enabled THEN the system SHALL compare checksums, row counts, or run API tests after migration
4. WHEN maintenance mode is enabled THEN the system SHALL activate maintenance mode on the destination system during migration
5. IF any verification step fails THEN the system SHALL halt the process and provide detailed error information

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a user managing multiple migrations, I want to schedule migrations and monitor their progress through both CLI and API, so that I can run migrations at optimal times and track their status programmatically.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user selects immediate migration via CLI THEN the system SHALL start the migration process with Rich progress bars and real-time updates
2. WHEN the user selects scheduled migration THEN the system SHALL allow setting specific date/time or cron expressions
3. WHEN a migration is triggered via API THEN the system SHALL return a migration session ID for status tracking
4. WHEN querying migration status via API THEN the system SHALL return detailed progress information in JSON format
5. WHEN a migration is running THEN the CLI SHALL display real-time progress updates using Rich progress bars
6. WHEN a migration completes THEN the system SHALL provide a detailed summary report accessible via both CLI and API
7. WHEN a migration fails THEN the system SHALL log detailed error information and suggest remediation steps

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a user with complex migration needs, I want to validate my configuration before execution, so that I can catch potential issues early and avoid failed migrations.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user completes the configuration THEN the system SHALL perform pre-migration validation checks
2. WHEN validation is performed THEN the system SHALL test connectivity to source and destination systems
3. WHEN validation is performed THEN the system SHALL verify required tools and permissions are available
4. IF validation fails THEN the system SHALL provide specific error messages and remediation suggestions
5. WHEN all validations pass THEN the system SHALL display a confirmation summary before proceeding

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a user migrating between different platforms, I want the system to handle platform-specific requirements automatically using Python modules, so that I don't need to manually configure complex migration parameters.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN migrating between cloud platforms THEN the system SHALL automatically configure appropriate Python SDK tools (boto3, google-cloud-*, azure-*) and authentication
2. WHEN migrating containerized applications THEN the system SHALL use docker-py and kubernetes Python client for volume and configuration migrations
3. WHEN migrating CMS systems (WordPress, Drupal) THEN the system SHALL preserve themes, plugins, and configuration settings using platform-specific modules
4. WHEN migrating framework applications (Django, Flask, FastAPI) THEN the system SHALL handle environment variables, dependencies, and build processes
5. WHEN using presets THEN the system SHALL auto-configure common stacks (WordPress/MySQL, Django/Postgres, etc.) with sensible defaults
6. IF platform-specific requirements cannot be met THEN the system SHALL provide clear guidance on manual steps required

### Requirement 9

**User Story:** As a user with hosting control panels, I want to migrate from cPanel, DirectAdmin, or Plesk environments, so that I can move my websites and databases from shared hosting to other platforms.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN migrating from cPanel THEN the system SHALL use cPanel API v2/UAPI to extract account information, databases, and file structures
2. WHEN migrating from DirectAdmin THEN the system SHALL use DirectAdmin API to access user accounts, domains, and database configurations

4. WHEN extracting from control panels THEN the system SHALL preserve email accounts, DNS records, and SSL certificates where possible
5. WHEN control panel APIs are unavailable THEN the system SHALL provide alternative methods using SSH/FTP access with file system parsing
6. WHEN migrating control panel data THEN the system SHALL map control panel-specific configurations to destination platform equivalents
7. IF control panel access fails THEN the system SHALL provide detailed troubleshooting steps and alternative migration paths
### Requi
rement 8
