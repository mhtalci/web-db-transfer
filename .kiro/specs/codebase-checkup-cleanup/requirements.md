# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The codebase checkup and cleanup feature provides comprehensive analysis and automated maintenance capabilities for the migration assistant codebase. This feature will systematically examine code quality, identify issues, remove redundancies, optimize structure, and ensure consistency across the entire project. The system will provide actionable insights and automated fixes to maintain a clean, efficient, and maintainable codebase.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to perform automated code quality analysis, so that I can identify and fix issues before they impact the project.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the checkup is initiated THEN the system SHALL scan all Python files for syntax errors, style violations, and code smells
2. WHEN analyzing code quality THEN the system SHALL check for PEP 8 compliance, unused imports, and dead code
3. WHEN quality issues are found THEN the system SHALL generate a detailed report with file locations and severity levels
4. WHEN the analysis is complete THEN the system SHALL provide automated fix suggestions for common issues

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to identify and remove duplicate code, so that I can reduce maintenance overhead and improve code consistency.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN scanning for duplicates THEN the system SHALL detect identical or similar code blocks across files
2. WHEN duplicate code is found THEN the system SHALL suggest refactoring opportunities and common abstractions
3. WHEN analyzing functions THEN the system SHALL identify redundant implementations with similar logic
4. WHEN duplicates are detected THEN the system SHALL provide confidence scores and impact assessments

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to analyze import dependencies and remove unused modules, so that I can optimize the codebase and reduce complexity.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN analyzing imports THEN the system SHALL identify all unused import statements across the codebase
2. WHEN checking dependencies THEN the system SHALL detect circular imports and suggest resolution strategies
3. WHEN examining modules THEN the system SHALL identify orphaned files with no references
4. WHEN import issues are found THEN the system SHALL provide safe removal recommendations

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to validate test coverage and identify gaps, so that I can ensure comprehensive testing of the codebase.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN analyzing test coverage THEN the system SHALL generate coverage reports for all modules
2. WHEN examining tests THEN the system SHALL identify untested functions and classes
3. WHEN checking test quality THEN the system SHALL detect obsolete or redundant test cases
4. WHEN coverage gaps are found THEN the system SHALL suggest specific test implementations needed

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to standardize code formatting and structure, so that I can maintain consistency across the entire project.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN formatting code THEN the system SHALL apply consistent indentation, spacing, and line breaks
2. WHEN organizing imports THEN the system SHALL sort and group imports according to PEP 8 standards
3. WHEN structuring files THEN the system SHALL ensure consistent docstring formats and type hints
4. WHEN standardizing is complete THEN the system SHALL preserve all functional behavior

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to optimize file organization and directory structure, so that I can improve code discoverability and maintainability.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN analyzing structure THEN the system SHALL evaluate current directory organization against best practices
2. WHEN examining modules THEN the system SHALL identify misplaced files and suggest better locations
3. WHEN checking organization THEN the system SHALL detect empty directories and unnecessary nesting
4. WHEN restructuring is needed THEN the system SHALL provide migration plans with minimal disruption

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to validate configuration files and documentation, so that I can ensure project setup and usage instructions are accurate.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN checking configurations THEN the system SHALL validate pyproject.toml, docker files, and CI/CD configs
2. WHEN examining documentation THEN the system SHALL verify code examples and API references are current
3. WHEN analyzing README files THEN the system SHALL ensure installation and usage instructions work
4. WHEN validation fails THEN the system SHALL provide specific correction recommendations

### Requirement 8

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to generate comprehensive cleanup reports, so that I can track improvements and plan future maintenance.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN cleanup is complete THEN the system SHALL generate detailed before/after comparison reports
2. WHEN reporting results THEN the system SHALL include metrics on code quality improvements
3. WHEN documenting changes THEN the system SHALL provide summaries of all modifications made
4. WHEN generating reports THEN the system SHALL export results in multiple formats (JSON, HTML, markdown)
