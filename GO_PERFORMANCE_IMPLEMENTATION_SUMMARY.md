- **Go operation fails**: Falls back to Python with logging
- **Configurable preferences**: Can prefer Python over Go if desired
- **Graceful degradation**: Never fails due to Go unavailability

#### Performance Comparison
```python
# Built-in performance comparison
comparison = await engine.compare_performance(
    "copy", "source.txt", "dest.txt", iterations=3
)
# Returns detailed metrics including speedup ratios
```

### Performance Comparison Results

#### File Copy Operations (550KB files)
- **Go**: 11-13ms avg, 101-123 MB/s
- **Python**: 1ms avg, 749-809 MB/s (faster for small files due to no subprocess overhead)
- **Hybrid**: Automatically selects best engine

#### Checksum Calculations (3 files)
